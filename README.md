=======================================================

The cz_necous layout by Marek Neƒçada, ported to android by himself.

This is for physical keyboards.


Build instructions
------------------

The original repo is more than 5 years old and the build environment has not
been updated, therefore old Android SDK Tools are needed (because ant has been removed
from Android SDK in the newer versions). Read more about
[the problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42912824/the-ant-folder-is-suddenly-missing-from-android-sdk-did-google-remove-it)
and [a workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47821206).

TODO make it working also with newer android SDK.

Meanwhile, do this:
